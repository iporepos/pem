Management Units
############################################

An important component of the PEM framework is the creation of **Management Units**, denoted as UPG â€”
spatial zones that organize and guide marine management actions.

These units are derived from **input data** such as bathymetry, habitats, and coastal uses,
combined with **expert-defined thresholds** for distance, depth, and sensitivity.
The process groups similar areas into **nested spatial units**, allowing analysis and planning at multiple scales.

UPGs are used to support **decision-making and scenario analysis**, ensuring that management strategies
reflect ecological patterns, human activities, and the connectivity between land and sea.
