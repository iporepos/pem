.. warning::

   This project is under active development.

The **PEM Project** (*Planejamento Espacial Marinho do Brasil*, or *Marine Spatial Planning for Brazil*)
is a brazilian national initiative focused on developing **spatially explicit guidelines** for the sustainable
use and management of Brazilâ€™s marine environment. It supports the implementation of
**Marine Spatial Planning (MSP)** across the country, integrating ecological, social,
and economic dimensions of the ocean.

This repository hosts **R and Python scripts** that ensure **reproducibility** of the analytical
methods and mapping procedures applied in the **PEM Sul** (*Southern Marine Spatial Plan*).
Also, the repository hosts key notes on more general information, referred as the **PEM framework**.

Each script is designed to operate independently, targeting specific stages of
the PEM framework.
