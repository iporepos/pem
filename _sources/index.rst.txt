Scripts for marine spatial planning in Brazil.

.. warning::

   This project is under active development.

The **PEM Project** (*Planejamento Espacial Marinho do Brasil*, or *Marine Spatial Planning for Brazil*)
is a national initiative focused on developing **spatially explicit guidelines** for the sustainable
use and management of Brazil’s marine environment. It supports the implementation of
**Marine Spatial Planning (MSP)** across the country, integrating ecological, social,
and economic dimensions of the ocean.

This repository hosts **R and Python scripts** that ensure **reproducibility** of the analytical
methods and mapping procedures applied in the **PEM Sul** (*Southern Marine Spatial Plan*).

Each script is designed to operate independently, targeting specific stages of
the general methodological workflow. The general workflow aims to:

* Convert and analyze spatial information on **marine uses** and **habitats**.
* Integrate data to support ecosystem-based marine management.
* Develop the **Marine Use Performance Index** — **IDUSE-Mar** (*Índice de Desempenho do Uso de Serviços Ecossistêmicos do Mar*), a measure that evaluates how marine uses interact with and depend on ecosystem services.

By maintaining all analytical scripts in a single repository, the project ensures
**transparency**, **reproducibility**, and **consistency** across different
PEM regional plans. The scripts can be adapted or extended for other
Brazilian coastal and marine regions following the same methodological principles.
