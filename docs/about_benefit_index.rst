Benefit Index
############################################


The **Benefit Index** expresses the value generated by ocean uses and realized on
land. Although activities occur offshore, their benefits typically emerge at
**coastal hubs** — cities, ports, processing centers, or other facilities where
economic or social gains materialize. The framework focuses on this point of
emergence rather than the full production chain, even when value may later accrue
far from the coast.

            Conceptual elements of the Benefit Index.
            (a) Benefit suite: a hub receives a total benefit composed of multiple contributions from different users.
            (b) Single-source allocation: a user contributes benefit to one or more hubs from a single ocean area.
            (c) Multi-source allocation: a user with multiple spatial source areas distributes benefits to
            different hubs, creating a more complex benefit-flow structure.

            Elementos conceituais do Índice de Benefício.
            (a) Portfólio de benefícios: um hub recebe um benefício total composto por múltiplas contribuições de diferentes usuários.
            (b) Alocação de fonte única: um usuário contribui com benefício para um ou mais hubs a partir de uma única área oceânica.
            (c) Alocação de múltiplas fontes: um usuário com diversas áreas espaciais de origem distribui benefícios para diferentes hubs, formando uma estrutura de fluxo de benefícios mais complexa.

Users and Hubs
==============================================

In the PEM framework, a **user** is defined as an **economic sector** that
operates in the ocean and possesses a characteristic set of practices and modes
of use. A user is *not* an individual company. For example, *fisheries* as a
sector constitute one user, even though many firms participate in it. Likewise,
*offshore wind energy*, *tourism*, or *maritime transport* may each represent a
distinct user.

Each user aggregates all activities of the sector but may operate across
multiple spatial locations. These locations—specific patches or areas in the
ocean—are referred to as **sources of benefit**. A single user may therefore
have one or many sources, each contributing differently to the total benefit
flow.

Ocean users are linked to Hubs through **teleconnections**: multiple activities
can direct their benefits to a single location. A port, for example, may receive
value from fisheries, offshore energy, tourism, and shipping. This set of benefits
is referred as the the **Hub Benefit Suite**.

Benefit Allocation
==============================================

Two mechanisms describe how benefits flow from ocean space to hubs:

**Single-source allocation**.
A user has one spatial source (e.g., a single fishing ground) but may distribute
its benefits across multiple hubs. Part of the benefit may flow to one port,
while the remainder supports another.

**Multi-source allocation**.
A user consists of several spatial sources—such as multiple fishing areas or
multiple offshore wind farms—each contributing differently to one or more hubs.
This allows benefits to be partitioned according to the spatial origin of the
activity.

Benefit Spatial Expression
==============================================

The spatial expression of benefits describes how the value generated by an ocean
user is represented in geographic space once it is allocated to a hub.
This expression depends on both the allocation mode (single-source or multi-source)
and the spatial nature of the activity, ranging from well-defined operational
areas to diffuse and continuous patterns.

Three main types of spatial expression are distinguished in the framework.

**Polygon-based expression**
In multi-source allocation, benefits originate from multiple, spatially
discrete source areas. These sources are typically represented as polygons,
corresponding to well-defined and bounded operational zones. Examples include
offshore oil and gas fields, wind farms, aquaculture sites, or licensed extraction areas.
Each polygon represents an independent source of benefit, allowing
contributions to be partitioned according to their spatial origin and
combined consistently within the benefit-flow structure.

**Kernel-density expression**
Some single-source activities generate benefits from localized points or
linear features but influence surrounding ocean space in a gradual and
distance-dependent manner. In these cases, benefits are represented using
a kernel density approach.

Kernel density describes a process in which benefit intensity is highest near
the source (e.g., coastal cities, ports, or tourism gateways) and
decreases smoothly with distance, forming a continuous surface like a heatmap.
This approach is suitable for activities such as coastal tourism, where
benefits are emitted from specific coastal hubs but spread
offshore without sharp boundaries.

**Intensity surface expression**
Other single-source activities are not meaningfully linked to an emitting location
but instead emerge from the cumulative intensity of use across the ocean
space itself. These benefits are expressed as continuous intensity surfaces,
often interpreted as fuzzy representations. Examples include
industrial fishing effort, shipping density, or recurrent vessel traffic,
where benefit generation reflects the spatial distribution of activity rather
than proximity to a fixed source. Unlike kernel density, intensity surfaces
are derived directly from observed or modeled use patterns within the ocean domain.

Together, these spatial expressions ensure that benefits can be represented
in ways that reflect the operational reality of each sector, while remaining
compatible with hub-based allocation and cumulative spatial analysis.

Benefit Assessment
==============================================

The Benefit Index is derived from an **economic proxy** :math:`E` that quantifies the
value that flows from the Users to the hub — such as jobs, tax revenue, or production
measures — depending on available data. Information constrains may also require to define hubs at the level
of coastal municipalities.

For a given hub :math:`i`, the Benefit Index is computed
as the sum of the economic proxy :math:`E` for all :math:`N` Users :math:`j`.

.. math::

    B_i = \sum_{j = 1}^{N} \mathcal{B}(E_{i, j})

Where the function :math:`\mathcal{B}()` converts the economic proxy into a
unitless index.

Mapping the Benefit
==============================================

The Benefit Index must be **mapped back to the ocean space**, which requires
identifying the **spatial sources** that generate the benefit flowing to each
hub. In simple cases, a hub receives value from a single user and a single
source; in real scenarios, multiple users and multiple sources commonly feed the
same hub. Because these relationships are not always directly measurable, the
framework relies on **expert judgment** to ensure that spatial allocations
reflect actual sector practices and economic connections.

Once sources are defined, the Benefit Index concentrated at the hub can be
translated into **Benefit Density** in the ocean space model,
which expresses how much benefit is generated per unit area. **Large source
areas** with modest benefit yield **low density**, while **small yet productive
areas** produce **high density**. Thus, two sources may contribute the same
benefit to a hub but differ sharply in density due to their **spatial footprints**.
Benefit Density highlights how efficiently ocean space is used and helps
identify activities that deliver high value with lower spatial pressure.

Each hub produces its own Benefit Density map, showing where and how
intensely ocean areas contribute value to that hub. Using **map algebra** (e.g.,
summing layers), the individual hub maps can be added to generate the **Accumulated
Benefit Density** surface, capturing the overall economic productivity of the
ocean space across all hubs and users.

            Mapping Benefit back to the ocean.
            (a) Benefit density concept: each user generates spatially distributed benefits whose intensity depends on how concentrated or diffuse the contributing ocean area is, reflecting differences in spatial efficiency.
            (b) Hub-specific and cumulative density maps: each hub has its own benefit-density map; overlapping contributions from multiple hubs or users can be summed through map algebra, producing areas of higher cumulative benefit density.

            Mapeando o Benefício de volta ao oceano.
            (a) Conceito de densidade de benefício: cada usuário gera benefícios distribuídos espacialmente, cuja intensidade depende de quão concentrada ou difusa é a área oceânica que os origina, refletindo diferenças de eficiência espacial.
            (b) Mapas de densidade específicos e cumulativos por hub: cada hub possui seu próprio mapa de densidade de benefício; contribuições sobrepostas de múltiplos hubs ou usuários podem ser somadas por meio de álgebra de mapas, produzindo áreas de maior densidade de benefício cumulativa.
